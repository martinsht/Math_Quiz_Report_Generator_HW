I have created a Quiz assessment with division, multiplication, subtraction and sum. I use random generator to choose each case. 
I also use random generator for the two numbers (they are in the range from 1 to 20).
After the user enters their answer, I store the question with the answer and whether it is correct or not into a text file with the name of user.
